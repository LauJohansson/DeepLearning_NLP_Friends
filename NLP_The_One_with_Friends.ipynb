        "We build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. Through tuning of hyperparameters and regularization through variational sequence length and DropConnect we achieve a perplexity value on the Penn Treebank dataset. We then utilize the found model to generate dialogue for the TV-series “Friends”. To this end, we pretrain the model on Wikipedia text and further tune the hyperparameters to fit “Friends”. Finally, we show a subset of the predicted dialogue and visualise the found semantics of “Friends” through t-SNE on the embedding weights.  \n",
