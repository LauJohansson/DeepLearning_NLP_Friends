*Authors: Daniel Juhász Vigild, Jonas Søbro Christophersen & Lau Johansson* \



This repository contains hand-in assignment for the DTU course 02456 Deep Learning. 

The exercises are written in Python programming language and formatted into Jupyter Notebooks.

This repository is heavily inspired by previous works, in particular:
